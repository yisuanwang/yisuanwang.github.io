üëã I am currently pursuing a MPhil degree in Data Science at Tsinghua University. My research interests include AI Agent, 3D AIGC, and Avatar (Human-centered generation, rigging and driving, including image and video or 3D and 4D generation.), especially in areas that have a strong connection to humans. And would like to realize AGI for the benefit of humanity through generative AI.
