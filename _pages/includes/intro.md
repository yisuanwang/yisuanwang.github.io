👋I am currently pursuing a master's degree in data science at Tsinghua University, with a research focus on 3D AIGC.

🤔My research interests include large language models, large multimodal models, image, video, and 3D generative model. And would like to realize AGI for the benefit of humanity through generative AI.
I am currently working on LLM as Agent, 2D/3D AIGC, 3D Avatar related research. Especially research related to human.
