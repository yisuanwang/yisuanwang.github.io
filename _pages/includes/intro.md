👋 I am currently pursuing a MPhil degree in data science at Tsinghua University, with a research focus on 3D AIGC.

🤔 My research interests include LLM as Agent, 2D/3D AIGC, and Avatar, especially in areas that have a strong connection to humans. And would like to realize AGI for the benefit of humanity through generative AI.
My google scholar is here <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uVMnzPMAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fyisuanwangn%2Fyisuanwang.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>

🎓 I graduated from **Harbin Engineering University with a B.S. degree in Software Engineering**, supervised by Prof. **[Chao Li](https://mohub.net/help/MoHub/UserServiceCases/Cases1.html#%E6%95%99%E5%B8%88%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D)**.
I had an internship at the **Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences**, supervised by Prof. **[Yubo Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9z7GPxIAAAAJ)**.
In addition, I had a good time with Prof. **[Hao Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ygQznUQAAAAJ)** at **Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University**.

😥 I'll be [emo](https://yisuanwang.github.io/emo) on a regular basis, which looks to be caused by not being able to write a paper.
