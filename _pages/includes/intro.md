👋 I am a first-year research master’s student at Tsinghua University. My research interests span avatars, AI agents, AIGC, and embodied AI, especially in areas that have a strong connection to humans.
And would like to realize AGI for the benefit of humanity through generative AI.
My google scholar is here <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uVMnzPMAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fyisuanwang%2Fyisuanwang.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>

🎓 I graduated first in my college (rank 1/233) with a B.S. in Software Engineering from **[Harbin Engineering University](https://english.hrbeu.edu.cn/)**.
I am now a first-year master’s student at Tsinghua University, supervised by **Prof [Ruqi Huang](https://rqhuang88.github.io/)**, and expect to graduate in **Fall 2027**.
